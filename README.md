I wanted to make git accessible to everyone.

## Why Rust?
Rust is great for working with the command line and is one of my favorite programming languages right now.

You can copy the source code in the src/main.rs to use in your project. It will generate a random commit message so that there will not always be the same commit message.
### Git Started
Git started by cloneing the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xpressiscool/git-automation.git
```
Next make any changes you want.
Now you can run the command line by running the following command:
```bash
./target/debug/automate.exe
```
I love programming!
