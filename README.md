# Git Automation Tool

## Why?
I wanted to make git accessible to everyone.

## Why Rust?
Rust is great for working with the command line and is one of my favorite programming languages right now.

### Git Started
Git started by cloneing the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xpressiscool/git-automation.git
```
Next make any changes you want.
Now you can run the command line by running the following command:
```bash
./target/debug/automate.exe
```
